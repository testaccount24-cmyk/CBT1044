/*
 This is the CBTXREF package.  CBTXREF is an ISPF dialog using table
 CBTSCAN that provides a cross-reference showing which membernames are
 present on which CBT file(s).  The primary routine is CBTXREF.  Several
 subsidiary subroutines are included as well.  The calling sequence for any
 of the routines in this package can be obtained by sending a question mark
 as the first parameter:
         ===> tso dup ?

 Also included is ISPF table CBTSCAN.  This member should be moved to an
 appropriate ISPTLIB dataset.  CBTSCAN details the entire CBT inventory
 (with some small exceptions) whether or not those files are present on
 a remote system.  The CBTSCAN table is maintained at the CBTTape site
 and should be downloaded periodically to pick up any changes.

 Routine KED is designed to have two aliases: KBR and KVW.  Once KED is
 loaded to your SYSEXEC or SYSPROC, run REALIAS against it.  REALIAS will
 establish the proper aliases.  If KED ever requires a change, rerun
 REALIAS after the change.  Member $COPEXEC in this package uses IEBCOPY to
 transfer KED --with its aliases-- obviating the need for an initial
 REALIAS execution.

 Both KED and CBTXREF will establish their own command table entries if
 requested.  To request these routines to build new command table entries,
 call them with INSTALL as a parameter:
     ===> tso KED (( INSTALL
              (generates KBR, KED, and KVW)
     ===> tso CBTXREF (( INSTALL
              (generates XREF )
 FCCMDUPD, the routine that writes the command table entries, cannot write
 directly to the DASD original of a table that is currently open, so
 specify a non-open copy of the intended command table for the
 newly-generated commands, and IEBCOPY that copy to the appropriate
 destination.

 CBTXREF v.2 uses RUNDATA to supply certain run-time parameters,
 and DFLTTLIB to supply the name of ISPF table libraries.  Installers
 should preload table RUNDATA with HLQ and LIMIT, as these datapoints
 are expected to be supplied via RUNDATA.  Preload the RUNDATA table
 with a short one-time REXX routine:

       "NEWSTACK"
       queue "TBLKEY CBTXREF"
       queue "HLQ CBT"   /* high-level used by local CBT libraries */
       queue "LIMIT 60"  /* Max # of libraries shown for a single query */
       "RUNDATA WRITE "
       "DELSTACK"

 Obviously, it's not possible to operate on files that don't exist on your
 site, so 'missing' files are automatically excluded from certain
 processes.  If your site typically downloads a complete copy of the CBT
 inventory, there won't be any missing files.
